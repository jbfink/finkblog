Hey folks,

Going to have a bigger post about job search advice at a later date, but I wanted to write a bit about one aspect of both
job searching and job performance, mobility.

I give out a fair amount of advice to new librarians and library school students about their first jobs, and there's one thing I used to do all the time that I don't do anymore. I used to say "The number one thing that you can do to get a job is to be mobile. Getting work around where you graduate is hard -- competition is brutal.". I don't say that anymore.

Why?

It's not that it's not *true*. It is. But it's only *true*, it's not actually useful or kind. To be an ideal piece of advice, it should be all three. Why, then, isn't it useful?

It's not useful because *everybody already knows if they can move or not*.  They know! Some wiseass 25 years into his career stroking his beard and saying "You know, moving is essential" is *completely* unhelpful. It's not actually going to be of any use. Nobody's going to think "You know, he's right." They're going to have *legitmate factors* -- things like family, money, support networks, etc. that detail whether or not they can move and where they can move to.

Let's get a thing straight though. Mobility is privilege. It's a *privelege* to be able to move across the country, even with financial support. It's a privelege to be able to leave your home for days/weeks at a time. It's not something everyone can do. 

* job search advice history
* environmental impact
* Cost
